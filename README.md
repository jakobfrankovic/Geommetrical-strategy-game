# Geommetrical-strategy-game
## Description of the project:
We will create a strategy game where the dynamics of play are similar (and simplified to a 2D version) to those of [Stick war](https://www.google.com/search?q=stick+war&rlz=1C1CHBD_enSI870SI870&sxsrf=ALiCzsbW7GXfbUzEd74wXAanxx0JJu1hcQ:1651837377096&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjsmdrg5cr3AhXwS_EDHWDMB_EQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1680&bih=882&dpr=1#imgrc=oKU4aPD7sIfZsM).
The strategy game will be based around geommetrical figures that players can spawn and then fight each other to win the game.

At the beginning of the game every player already spawns with a mothership. The goal of each player is to destroy the enemy mothership to win.

## Goals of the project:
* Players spawn different unique geommetrical figures that move and each have their own purpose (some can fight the enemy figures, some generate resources etc.)
* Generated income from resources from a resource generator figure can be used to spawn other more advanced geommetrical figures.
* List of geommetrical figures(incomplete) : 
  * light warship (fast but fragile)
  * heavy warship (slow but large HP)
  * resource generator (passive, but generates resources that can be used to spawn more ships)
  * mothership (passive, the main ship of the player, extremely large HP, can't move. If it is destroyed, the player loses)
